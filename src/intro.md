# About Me

Hi there :wave:, this is tommy's repository to store some markdown file about some tech knowledge, so this is only way I put my note   using web store. Generally speaking, I am not a purely Geek, because I haven't attend any famous open source project just like Spring Framework or some other tech eco. But I really want to join it and contribute to it. May be my long life.

If you read in there, you may realized that I have very poor English, Yeah :smile:, It's true, and I decided to improve my spoken english better and better, I really love learning english of crouse without any exams you know :sweat_smile:. I hate every forms of english exams.

::: warning Note

This such static website was not fulfilling yet, it was just a front end framework, I will fix it and add a lot of markdown file into this blog from yuque, I hate yuque.
